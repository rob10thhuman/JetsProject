## Jets Project 

### Week 2 Homework for Skill Distillery 

This program displays and manages a fleet of Jet objects. 

### Hour 1-3 
I created the classes and much of the structure I believed I need. 

### Hour 4-5 
I created the rest of the structure. Had an existential revelation 
that objects created through an array are essentially the same as those 
created from a blueprint. 

### Hour 5-6 
Spent this time looking at the screen trying to envision what I need to do
to connect these syntaxtually (sp?). Conceptually, I think I get it. 

### Day 2 
A lot of trial and error in building this program out as far as I have. 
I am really trying to grasp the connections between the classes and the why. 
I also am trying to grasp the connections to the array. I seem to be able to access
it to display data but I cannot add to it yet.
